# Machine Learning Fundamentals
Machine Learning (ML) is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## 1. Types of Learning
Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data.

Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).

Classification: Predicting discrete labels (e.g., Spam vs. Not Spam).

Unsupervised Learning: The model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

Clustering: Grouping similar customers.

Association: Finding rules like "People who buy milk also buy bread."

Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error using rewards and penalties (used in robotics and gaming).

## 2. Key Challenges
Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data (it "memorizes" noise).

Underfitting: The model is too simple to capture the underlying trend.

Data Quality: "Garbage in, garbage out." Missing values, outliers, and biased data are major hurdles.
